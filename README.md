## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Browser Extension

**For Chrome/Chromium browsers:**
1. Download `opendia-chrome-1.0.6.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/aaronjmars/opendia/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or your browser's extension page)
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder

**For Firefox:**
1. Download `opendia-firefox-1.0.6.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/aaronjmars/opendia/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
4. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
5. Select the `manifest.json` file from the extracted folder

> **Note**: Firefox extensions are loaded as temporary add-ons and will be removed when Firefox restarts. This is a Firefox limitation for unsigned extensions.

### 2. Connect to Your AI

**Option 1: Double-click Installation (Recommended)**
1. Download the `opendia.dxt` file from [releases](https://github.com/aaronjmars/opendia/releases)
2. Double-click the `.dxt` file to install automatically
3. The MCP will be added to your Claude Desktop configuration

**Option 2: Manual Configuration**
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opendia": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["opendia"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor or other AI tools**, use the same configuration or follow their specific setup instructions.

## Usage Modes

### Local Mode (Default)
```bash
npx opendia
```
- Chrome extension: ws://localhost:5555 (auto-discovery enabled)
- Claude Desktop: stdio (existing config)
- Local SSE: http://localhost:5556/sse

### Port Configuration
```bash
# Use custom ports
npx opendia --port=6000              # Uses 6000 (WebSocket) + 6001 (HTTP)
npx opendia --ws-port=5555 --http-port=5556  # Specify individually

# Handle port conflicts  
# Note: Existing OpenDia processes are automatically terminated on startup
```

### Auto-Tunnel Mode
```bash
npx opendia --tunnel
```
- Automatically creates ngrok tunnel
- Copy URL for ChatGPT/online AI services
- Local functionality preserved

**Note**: For auto-tunneling to work, you need ngrok installed:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ngrok
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install ngrok

# Or download from https://ngrok.com/download
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok

# Or download from https://ngrok.com/download
```

3. **OpenDia controls** your browser through the extension
4. **You get results** - AI can see what happened and respond intelligently

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

**Your data stays private**:
